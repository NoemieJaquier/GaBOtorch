# Examples
The following examples are available in GaBOflow:
### Kernels
| Sphere manifold      |           | 
|:------------- |:-------------| 
| sphere_kernels      | This example shows the use of different kernels for the hypershere manifold S^n , used for Gaussian process regression. | 
| sphere_gaussian_kernel_parameters      | This example shows the experimental selection of parameters for the Sphere Gaussian kernel.      |

| gabo_sphere_bound_constraints      | This example shows the use of Geometry-aware Bayesian optimization (GaBO) on the sphere S2 to optimize the Ackley function. In this example, the search domain is bounded and represents a subspace of the manifold. | 
| gabo_sphere_equality_constraints    | This example shows the use of Euclidean Bayesian optimization on the sphere S2 to optimize the Ackley function.  In this example, the parameters must satisfy equality constraints and the search space represents a subspace of the manifold. |
| gabo_sphere_equality_constraints    | This example shows the use of Euclidean Bayesian optimization on the sphere S2 to optimize the Ackley function.  In this example, the parameters must satisfy inequality constraints and the search space represents a subspace of the manifold. |

### BO on the SPD manifold
| Benchmark examples      |           | 
|:------------- |:-------------| 
| gabo_spd      | This example shows the use of Geometry-aware Bayesian optimization (GaBO) on the SPD manifold S2_++ to optimize the Ackley function. |
